# Chapter 5: Lotka-Volterra Interspecific Competition

## 5.1 Discrete and Continuous Time Models

### 5.1.1 Discrete time model

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_d N_t (1 - \alpha N_t)$$
\alpha is the per capita effect of each individual on each other, so the $$(1 - \alpha N_t)$$ portion is the density-dependence term.

Adding in interspecific competition:

$$N_{1,t+1} = N_{1,t} + r_{1,d} N_{1,t} (1 - \alpha_{11} N_{t,1} - \alpha_{12} N_{2,t})$$

in which $\alpha_{11}$ is the effect of species 1 on itself, and $\alpha_{12}$ is the effect of species 2 on the growth rate of species 1.

$$N_{2_,t+1} = N_{2,t} + r_{2,d} N_{2,t} (1 - \alpha_{21} N_{1,t} - \alpha_{22} N_{2,t})$$
in which $\alpha_{21}$ is the effect of species 1 on the growth rate of species 2, and $\alpha_{22}$ is the effect of species 2 on itself.
