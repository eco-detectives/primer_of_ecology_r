#Chapter 5: Lotka-Volterra Interspecific Competition

##5.1 Discrete and Continuous Time Models

###5.1.1 Discrete time model

$$N_{t+1} = N_t + r_d N_t (1 - \alpha N_t)$$
\alpha is the per capita effect of each individual on each other, so the $$(1 - \alpha N_t)$$ portion is the density-dependence term.
